üèõÔ∏è E-commerce Marketplace Architecture Overview
A full-fledged e-commerce marketplace is a complex system composed of several interconnected modules. Here's a breakdown of the key components you requested:

Front-End: The user interface for both buyers and sellers. This is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with a framework like Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness). It's what users interact with directly.

Back-End: The server-side logic that handles data processing, user authentication, and communication with the database. This would be written in PHP. It's the "engine" of the marketplace.

Database: Stores all the information, including user data, product listings, orders, and financial transactions. MySQL is a popular choice for this.

Core Systems:

Order Management System (OMS): Tracks the lifecycle of an order from placement to delivery.

Warehouse Management System (WMS): Manages inventory, stock levels, and product locations.

Transportation Management System (TMS): Handles logistics and shipping, connecting sellers to delivery services.

Client Relations Management (CRM): Manages customer and seller interactions, including support tickets and communication history.

Banking System: Processes payments, refunds, and manages seller payouts.

Tax Filing System: Calculates and manages sales tax, and generates reports for tax purposes.
